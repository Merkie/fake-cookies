### What is fake cookies?
Fake Cookies is a Python library that allows users to generate custom random strings. I got the idea when I found myself rewriting the same functions in many of my projects regarding http requests & API manipulation. Currently Fake Cookies has a few features such as generating random strings, generating random strings with a pattern (eg: aaa-aaaaa-aaa), and generating random mobile iOS device IDs. I'm planning on adding the ability to generate fake web headers and possibly some fake android device info.

**If you're seeing this we're still in development so there may be missing information from this README file or the Python files in this repo. Use with caution!**
